  "prompt": "A highly detailed and informative schematic diagram illustrating the feedback loop between urban heat island (UHI) intensity, green infrastructure (GI) efficacy, and atmospheric moisture dynamics. The diagram should visually contrast three distinct land-use zones: a Dense Built-up Area (high UHI, minimal GI), a Suburban Area (moderate UHI, scattered GI), and a Green Corridor/Park Area (low UHI, dense GI). Use layered visuals to show the flow: Incoming Solar Radiation (yellow arrows), Sensible Heat Flux (red arrows indicating high temperatures), and Latent Heat Flux/Evapotranspiration (blue or green wavy lines indicating cooling). Clearly label key variables: Albedo, Surface Temperature, and Air Temperature Profile, with small, illustrative bar charts or line graphs embedded within each zone. The overall style must be scientific illustration, 2D/3D hybrid vector style, using an analytical color palette of warm browns and reds for heat, and varying greens and light blues for moisture/vegetation. The graphic must be easy to follow and suitable for a scientific journal figure, focusing on clear, logical connections between variables. Use Chinese",
